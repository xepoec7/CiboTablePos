# CiboTablePos

###### (project is underdevelopment)

This ios/android app is created for specific restaurant. It should be used to let restaurant employes 
when new order from table arrives. On the restaurant table are qr codes when they are scaned, customers
would be taken to web page from where he can see what's on menu and order directly without any employee
of the restaurant.

This app is developed with React Native which takes care with one code of both android and ios app.

Some of the features such as printing slip on accepting order will be implemented in feature.

This project also serves to show the world some of my skills.
